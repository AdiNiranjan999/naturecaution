<p>Countries are failing to meet international targets to stop global forest loss and degradation by 2030,&nbsp;<a href="https://forestdeclaration.org/resources/forest-declaration-assessment-2022/">according to a report</a>. It is the first to measure progress since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03034-z">world leaders set the targets last year</a>&nbsp;at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, UK. Preserving forests, which can store carbon and, in some cases, provide local cooling, is a crucial part of a larger strategy to curb global warming.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00934-6">Tropical forests have big climate benefits beyond carbon storage</a></p>

<p>The analysis, called the Forest Declaration Assessment, shows that the rate of global deforestation slowed by 6.3% in 2021, compared with the baseline average for 2018–20. But this “modest” progress falls short of the annual 10% cut needed to end deforestation by 2030, says Erin Matson, a consultant at Climate Focus, an advisory company headquartered in Amsterdam, and author of the assessment, published on 24 October.</p>

<p>“It’s a good start, but we are not on track,” Matson said at a press briefing, although she cautioned that the assessment looks at only one year’s worth of data. A clearer picture of deforestation trends will emerge in successive years, she added.</p>

<p>The assessment, which was carried out by a number of civil-society and research groups, including the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington DC, comes as nations gear up for the next big climate summit (COP27), to be held in November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Scientists agree that in order to limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C above preindustrial levels — a threshold beyond which Earth’s climate will become profoundly disrupted — deforestation must end.</p>

<h2>Tropical forests are key</h2>

<p>To track deforestation over the past year, the groups analysed indicators such as changes in forest canopy, as measured by satellite data, and the forest landscape integrity index, which is a measure of the ecological health of forests. The slow progress they found is mainly attributable to a few tropical countries where deforestation is highest (see ‘Progress report’). Among them is Brazil — the world’s largest contributor to tree loss — which saw a 3% rise in the rate of deforestation in 2021, compared with the baseline years. Rates also rose in heavy deforesters Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, by 6% and 3%, respectively, over the same period.</p>

<p>The loss of tropical forests, in particular, is worrisome because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00934-6">a growing body of research shows</a>&nbsp;that besides sequestering carbon, these forests can physically cool nearby areas by creating clouds, humidifying the air and releasing certain cooling molecules. Keeping tropical forests standing provides a massive boost to global cooling that current policies ignore, says a report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wri.org/research/not-just-carbon-capturing-benefits-forests-climate">“Not Just Carbon”</a>, released alongside the Forest Declaration Assessment.</p>

<p>A region made up of tropical countries in Asia is the only one on track to halt deforestation by 2030, according to the assessment (see ‘Movement towards goal’). The region cut the rate at which it lost humid, old-growth forests last year by 20% from the 2018–20 baseline, mostly thanks to large strides made by Indonesia.</p>
